  <p id='sometext'>GUARD #1:  Found them?  In Mercea?  The coconut's tropical! <br>
    ARTHUR:  What do you mean? <br>
    GUARD #1:  Well, this is a temperate zone. <br>
    ARTHUR:  The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin
        or the plumber may seek warmer climes in winter yet these are not
        strangers to our land. <br>
    GUARD #1:  Are you suggesting coconuts migrate? <br>
    ARTHUR:  Not at all, they could be carried. <br>
    GUARD #1:  What -- a swallow carrying a coconut? <br>
    ARTHUR:  It could grip it by the husk! <br>
    GUARD #1:  It's not a question of where he grips it!  It's a simple
        question of weight ratios!  A five ounce bird could not carry a 1 pound
        coconut.</p>
